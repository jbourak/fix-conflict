# Worksheet: Version Control

*Note: data used in this simple analysis is from [UCL Machine Learning Repository: Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).*

Load the required libraries.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in the data `student-mat.csv`.
We convrt the final grade `G3` to a percent
(note that the value given is a score out of 20)
and give it a better name: `final_grade`.

```{r}
students <- null
```

Now let's explore the relationship between
our two variables using a scatter-plot.

```{r}
plot <- students |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = absences, y = G3)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  ggtitle("Student Absences vs. Final Grade (%)") +
  xlab("Number of absences") +
  ylab("Final grade (%)")
plot
```
