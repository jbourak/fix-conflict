# Worksheet: Version Control

*Note: data used in this simple analysis is from [UCL Machine Learning Repository: Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).*

Load the required libraries.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in the data `student-mat.csv`.
We convrt the final grade `G3` to a percent
(note that the value given is a score out of 20)
and give it a better name: `final_grade`.
Lastly, we select only the columns we are interested in.

```{r}
students <- read_delim("student-mat.csv", delim = ";") |> 
  mutate(final_grade = (G3 / 20) * 100) |> 
  select(absences, final_grade)
```

Now let's explore the relationship between
our two variables using a scatter-plot.

```{r}
plot <- NULL
```
